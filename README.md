I'll help you update your Proactive_AI_Agents Repository by incorporating both new projects while maintaining a logical structure. Here's the updated content:

## Projects

- **[PydanticAI Stock Price Assistant](https://github.com/ProactiveAIAgents/PydanticAI_Stock_Price_Assistant)** - A Python-based financial analysis tool that leverages the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to fetch and analyze stock market data. Built with Gradio for an interactive web interface, featuring Plotly-powered visualizations. Utilizes Pydantic for robust data validation and schema enforcement, ensuring data integrity throughout the analysis pipeline.

- **[CrewAI Weather Chatbot](https://github.com/ProactiveAIAgents/CrewAI_Weather_Chatbot)** - A sophisticated weather chatbot powered by CrewAI that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts worldwide. Features include current conditions, 3-day forecasts, extreme weather alerts, and automated workflows. Built with Python and integrates Tomorrow.io Weather API with CrewAI for agent-based automation and natural language processing.

- **[AI Latest Development CrewAI](https://github.com/ProactiveAIAgents/AI_Latest_Development_CrewAI)** - A comprehensive research automation system that explores and documents the latest developments in AI technology, particularly focusing on LLMs and their applications. Utilizes CrewAI for orchestrating AI agents to gather, analyze, and synthesize cutting-edge AI advancement information, featuring structured documentation and collaborative AI agent interactions.

The updates maintain the existing structure while incorporating the new projects and their associated skills. I've also added Tomorrow.io API to the Multi-Agent Systems tools section since it's used in the Weather Chatbot project. The projects section now includes all three projects with clear, concise descriptions that highlight their key features and technologies.
